# Overview

This project implements a Smart Order Router (SOR) for Solana DEXs (Raydium & Meteora).
The system:

- Accepts a trade request (tokenIn → tokenOut)
- Compares quotes from Raydium & Meteora (mocked)
- Selects the best route
- Processes the order in a BullMQ queue
- Streams real-time order status updates to the client via WebSocket
- This implementation uses mock DEX data (recommended in assignment).
- You can switch to real devnet execution later.

# Architecture
```
Client
 ├── REST: POST /api/orders/execute
 └── WebSocket: /api/orders/ws?orderId=<id>

Backend (Fastify)
 ├── Routes (orders.ts)
 ├── Queue Producer (index.ts)
 ├── Queue Worker (BullMQ Worker)
 ├── Mock DEX Router
 ├── Redis Pub/Sub → WebSocket Push
 └── PostgreSQL (order persistence)

Infrastructure
 ├── Redis (Docker)
 └── PostgreSQL (Docker)
```
# Features
- ### Smart DEX Routing
  Mock quotes from Raydium & Meteora with ~5% price difference.
  Choose lowest effective price.

- ### Background Job Processing
  Orders are not processed inline — they run inside a BullMQ worker.

- ### WebSocket Live Updates
  Client receives every stage:
  pending → routing → building → submitted → confirmed

- ### Redis Pub/Sub
  Worker publishes events → WS route pushes to frontend.

- ### Implements assignment requirements
  - DEX routing logic
  - WebSocket lifecycle
  - Queue concurrency
  - Retry logic
  - Proper architecture
  - Real-time streaming
  - Clean code + modular design

- ## Output should show:
  ```
  QUEUE: Starting worker...
  WORKER READY
  Server listening at http://127.0.0.1:3000
  ```

# How to Test the System
**Step 1 — Create an order**
(PowerShell)
```
curl -Method POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/orders/execute `
  -Headers @{ "Content-Type"="application/json" } `
  -Body '{ "tokenIn":"USDC", "tokenOut":"SOL", "amount":10 }'
```

Response:
```
{ "orderId": "cd4554df-47a3-4bf5-9024-3e17bc180220" }
```
**Step 2 — Subscribe to WebSocket**
```
wscat -c "ws://127.0.0.1:3000/api/orders/ws?orderId=<id>"
```

You will receive live events like:
```
{"status":"pending"}
{"status":"routing"}
{"status":"building"}
{"status":"submitted"}
{"status":"confirmed","txHash":"MOCKTX_abc123","executedPrice":9.83}
```
# API Reference
```
POST /api/orders/execute
```
Creates an order and pushes it into the queue.

Body:
```
{
  "side": "buy",
  "tokenIn": "USDC",
  "tokenOut": "SOL",
  "amount": 10
}

Response:
{
  "orderId": "uuid"
}
```
WebSocket: /api/orders/ws
Subscribe to order updates.

Example:
```
ws://127.0.0.1:3000/api/orders/ws?orderId=<uuid>
```
# Technologies Used
- Node.js + Fastify
- BullMQ + Redis
- PostgreSQL
- WebSocket

- Docker Compose

# Tests 
This repo includes:
- 10 unit tests
- 5 integration tests

Covers:
- DEX routing logic
- Queue behaviour

- Retry logic
- Pub/Sub messaging

**Run tests:**
```
npm test
```
# Postman / Insomnia Collection

Postman collection available at:
```
/postman/eterna_assignment_backend.json
```

It contains:
- Execute order (POST)
- WebSocket subscription
- Sample test orders

# Deployment

Backend deployed on:
```
<your-public-url>
```

(TODO: add after deploying on Railway / Render)

# Design Decisions
- Queue-based architecture ensures high scalability
- WebSocket only for streaming (not polling)
- Redis pub/sub decouples worker ↔ websocket
- Mock DEX layer makes whole system predictable
- Separation of concerns
  - routes/ for HTTP
  - queue/ for workers
  - services/MockDexRouter
  - pubsub/ for WS events
